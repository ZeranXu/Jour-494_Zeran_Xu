My name is Riccardo. I am Italian from Milan and I moved here in Los Angeles in 2005.
I simply love this city. Los Angeles always made me feel free, happy and since I am here in Downtown, more balanced.
Because I grew up and have been raised in a city like Milan, after few years I started to miss the authenticity of this city and finally I found it here in Downtown LA! 
I always love to share my place and my free time with all my friends and, I can tell being here helps a lot.
I work in the entertainment industry, I frequently leave for days or weeks and for this reason I can share my place with cool people that are visiting here.

On the off time he (tries) to play guitar and puts his six years of choir and music theory into use. Aside from working online in the perpetually changing internet scene, Zack also works closely with his wife on artistic projects that will hopefully be the foundation of their traveling dreams together. 
 
Melissa M. is the epitome of hip and fresh.  A printmaker at heart, she thrives on the tactile that is paper. Together with this love of paper, and skills attained, she creates handmade artists books, prints, and stationery that evoke a thoughtful cuteness. 

Mel and Zack are a unique couple: met in high school, best friends for years, sharers of tragedy and fun times, singers of many a song, married immediately and always working on a mystery since then. 

The ultimate goal for them (and most 9 to 5'ers) is to make a living off doing what they both love. 

They hope to travel the world for extended periods of time and spread joy the only way they know how: funky dancing, loud singing, nonstop comedy and making pretty things.

On the off time he (tries) to play guitar and puts his six years of choir and music theory into use. Aside from working online in the perpetually changing internet scene, Zack also works closely with his wife on artistic projects that will hopefully be the foundation of their traveling dreams together. 
 
Melissa M. is the epitome of hip and fresh.  A printmaker at heart, she thrives on the tactile that is paper. Together with this love of paper, and skills attained, she creates handmade artists books, prints, and stationery that evoke a thoughtful cuteness. 

Mel and Zack are a unique couple: met in high school, best friends for years, sharers of tragedy and fun times, singers of many a song, married immediately and always working on a mystery since then. 

The ultimate goal for them (and most 9 to 5'ers) is to make a living off doing what they both love. 

They hope to travel the world for extended periods of time and spread joy the only way they know how: funky dancing, loud singing, nonstop comedy and making pretty things.

I attend art openings and cultural events often. I'm also very connected to the art community as well as with neighborhood organizations. I serve on the board of our neighborhood council.

Although I love to attend art and music festivals as well as music shows, they've taken a back seat in the last three year's while I've been focussed on the expansion of my company with tours. 

The same has occurred for traveling except to destinations where there are art fairs such as Miami in December with Art basel (SCOPE Art Fair my favorite). My favorite past travel destinations have been internationally Bali, and in the U.S, Seattle. I've also spent quite a bit of time in Joshua Tree here in CA as well as France, where my sister has lived with her family for close to 30 years. I'm originally from NY and went to college in Massachusetts so the east coast is definitely in my blood too and I love to visit there as well. I was raised visiting Haiti when I was younger as my parents had an art gallery that was located in the beach community of Jacmel.

On my bucket list with travel would be destinations for good street art such as Berlin and Brazil, as well as places where there are old buildings that have interesting details. My favorite's are weathered, rusty and old industrial type buildings that have lots of layers and textures.

Activities I like to participate with in order to have balance in my life outside of work includes yoga, biking, hiking and snowboarding. 

I live a healthy lifestyle and love my green juices 

Laguna Beach was my hometown until seven years ago when I moved to LA. Although, I still like to go spend time there with with family and friends. 

I have my BS degree in Hospitality Management and  worked for many years with the hotel groups: Joie de Vivre, Marriott and The Ritz Carlton. The boutique hotels of Joie de Vivre are my favorite hotels and while being a Cultural Ambassador for them, I loved staying at many of their unique locations. 

With my background in hospitality, interest in art and in addition to providing tours in my neighborhood, you can be assured that your stay will be comfortable and I will connect you to all of the events and the neighborhood. You will leave feeling like a real 'insider"" of the Downtown Los Angeles Arts District--one of the most unique art-centric and rapidly changing neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

People & Travel are my greatest passions and I strive to be a woman of the world. Getting to know cultures and people from all walks of life puts a huge smile on my face. I always try to travel like a local (that's where you find the best food, music, and scenery). Music is my meditation; I can't help but get lost in the sounds! On my spare time I love exercising my creative muscles by crafting/building awesome things. I'm a sucker for rooftops, extra dirty vodka martinis, pizza, a good book, and dinosaurs.

My life motto: Life is for Love
(Not just the romantic kind! But you should love the life you live & all that it encompasses!)

I am an LA native and head up finance for a digital media and technology company.  I carefully styled my loft in a classic, rustic, and clean aesthetic.  The stainless steel appliances are new, the furniture is brand new or newly restored, the dining table is one-of-a-kind salvaged wood and seats 10, and the desk belonged to my father who gave it to me and I had it refinished in classic whitewash.

I'm looking for a professional single or couple and respectful tenant who will take good care of my loft while I am away.  

Just send me a note to get started.

During her stay her and her friends told me horror stories about how difficult it is for international travelers (especially ladies) to find a nice, comfortable, safe place to reside while traveling abroad so I decided to offer her old room for rent as a cozy safe haven. 

I'm very friendly and sweet and am a pretty quiet roomie. I don't have a set schedule but I'm often on the go and tend to be in bed by 11pm.

On the off time he (tries) to play guitar and puts his six years of choir and music theory into use. Aside from working online in the perpetually changing internet scene, Zack also works closely with his wife on artistic projects that will hopefully be the foundation of their traveling dreams together. 
 
Melissa M. is the epitome of hip and fresh.  A printmaker at heart, she thrives on the tactile that is paper. Together with this love of paper, and skills attained, she creates handmade artists books, prints, and stationery that evoke a thoughtful cuteness. 

Mel and Zack are a unique couple: met in high school, best friends for years, sharers of tragedy and fun times, singers of many a song, married immediately and always working on a mystery since then. 

The ultimate goal for them (and most 9 to 5'ers) is to make a living off doing what they both love. 

They hope to travel the world for extended periods of time and spread joy the only way they know how: funky dancing, loud singing, nonstop comedy and making pretty things.
